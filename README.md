# Moon Math topics

This repository is a collection of my personal notes and implementations as I explore the concepts presented in the [Moon Math Manual]([url](https://github.com/LeastAuthority/moonmath-manual)), a comprehensive guide to zk-SNARKs. The code here is primarily intended as a learning tool to help me gain a better intuition around proof systems, particularly in Rust. Itâ€™s not a production-ready library, but a way to solidify my understanding through hands-on experimentation.

I included topics from later chapters of the manual:
Circuits: Basic implementations and explorations of zero-knowledge circuits.
R1CS (Rank-1 Constraint Systems): Example constructions and their role in zk-SNARKs.
QAP (Quadratic Arithmetic Programs): How QAPs are used to convert R1CS into polynomial form.
Groth16 Implementation (Non-working): An attempt to implement Groth16, although it is currently incomplete and not functional.
